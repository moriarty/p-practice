Election Analytics                                                 Time: 20s
-----------------------------

It is an election time again.  This time, in Nova Scotia, NDP,
Liberals, Progressive Conservatives, and others, will try their luck
with voters.  The parties' analytical think tanks, as well as various
public opinion research companies are trying to make predictions based
on various polls.  Your task is to write a simple program to process
some of this data and give the worst-case and best-case predictions
for a given party.

More precisely, you program will be provided with a set of input cases,
one case per line.  Each case presents an electoral district, where the
input line contains the following:
- a party name, for which we are making this analysis.  Each party
  name is a string of up to 100 characters, with no white-space
  characters.
- a positive integer, representing the number of parties running in
  the district.
- a positive integer, representing number of voters in the district.
- a non-negative integer (let us call it minv), representing a minimal
  number of voters expected to vote for this party.
- a non-negative integer (let us call it maxv), representing a maximal
  number of voters expected to vote for this party.
You can assume that maxv >= minv.
Your task is to produce one line of output for each case containing
three words: 1. the given party name, 2. the worst-case scenario
represented as a word "lose" or "win", and 3. the best-case scenario
represented as a word "lose" or "win".  For the worst-case scenario,
you should assume that the party got the minimal number of votes, and
some other party got all other votes (except, of course, if this is
the only party in the district).  For the best-case scenario, you
should assume that the party got the maximal number of votes, and the
other votes are evenly split among other parties, giving this party
the best chance.  If the party is tied with another party for the
first position, we will still consider this a "win".

Input

The input consists of a sequence of lines, where each line contains a
string of non-blank characters and four integers as specified above.
The string and numbers are separated by some white-space characters.
You program needs to detect the end of the standard input; i.e., there
is no special ending line after all cases have finished.

Output

For each case, you program needs to print three strings separated by
one space character: the party name and two words, each being lose or
win.

Sample Input 1

NDP            3 1500 600 700
Liberals       2 2000 900 1000

Sample Output 1

NDP lose win
Liberals lose win
Conservatives lose win

Sample Input 2

A_Party 4 2000 1000 1005
X  4 2000 400 500

Z  1 2000 400 499

Sample Output 2
