PROBLEM: Efficient codes                                Time: 120s

Let S be a set of strings. An S-message is a concatenation of one
or more strings from S. For example, if S1 = {00,001,10}, then
0000100 and 1000 are two S1-messages. On the other hand, 000110
is not an S1-message. In practice the strings in S represent objects
of interest (colours, actions, temperatures, etc), and an S-message 
encodes a list of such objects.

DEFINITION A set of strings is called an efficient code, when the
following Condition is satisfied: 
  if an S-message begins with the concatenation of two strings s, t 
  from S, then there is no pair of strings u, v from S such that
  the message also begins with the concatenation of u, v and u is 
  different from s.

EXAMPLE: The set S1 above is not an efficient code because the
message 001000... starts with the concatenation of 00 and 10,
and also with the concatenation of 001 and 00, and 00 is different
from 001. On the other hand, the sets S2 = {00,001,110} and 
S3 = {00,11} are efficient codes.
In practice, the fact that S2 is an efficient code means that any
arbitrarily long S2-message x can be parsed correctly by finding
two S2-strings s and t in the beginning of x and returning s as 
the next S2-string in x, and then continuing the same parsing 
process on the S2-message that is equal to x with s removed.

Your program must read the number of test cases then, for each test case
read a positive integer N, and then N strings, 
one per line. You can assume that each string is nonempty and 
consists only of digits. If the set of the N strings is an efficient 
code, then your program must output "The set IS an efficient code."
Else, your program must output "The set is NOT an efficient code:"
followed by two pairs of strings violating the Condition such that
the first pair of strings is in one line and the second pair
of strings is in the next line--see sample input/output below.

Sample input 1:

The set IS an efficient code.
