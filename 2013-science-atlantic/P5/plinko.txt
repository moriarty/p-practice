Plinko                                                           Time: 20s

In a game of plinko, a player places a disc somewhere at the top of
a plinko board and lets it fall. The disc falls downwards, hitting
pegs in the board which redirects it left or right each time it moves
downwards. Depending on where the disc ends up at the bottom of the board,
various points can be awarded. The board has $n$ pegs in the first row,
and from there the board alternates between $n - 1$ and $n$ pegs (see
figure below). The board has $h$ rows of pegs.

In a modified version of the game, each time the disc strikes a peg,
a certain number of points are awarded. Write a program which, given a
modified plinko board, finds the maximum number of points that can be
achieved on that plinko board. Your input will be a textfile, with the
first line containing the integers $n$ and $h$ separated by whitespace. The
next $h$ lines will be the scores for the pegs, alternating between
lines with $n$ integers and $n - 1$ integers.
