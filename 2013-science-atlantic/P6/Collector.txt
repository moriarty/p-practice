Collector                                                   Time: 20s

A collector of artifacts likes to get everything in pairs.
After 20 years, he  decides to organize his collection, 
thus,  he displays all the items in his backyard and gives to each item 
from his collection a unique id string, that accurately describes the object.
He packs all the items in identical boxes, and labels them with the 
corresponding unique id string -- same id for each item of  a pair.
After he finishes labeling, he starts to move the items back into his basement.
When he has only one item left, a tornado takes it away.
Can you help the collector to identify the missing object?

Id strings consist of arbitrary  non-white characters 

input:
number of test cases
and for each case 
the number pairs of items
then the id strings.

output:
 the id of the missing item for each case 
 followed by a blank line


Example:
team.in 
2
3
abc
abc
bbac
bbac
bbb
4
12345678abc
12345678bca
12345
12345678bca
12345678abc
123456
12345

Output:
bbb

123456
